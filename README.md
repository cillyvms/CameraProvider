# CameraProvider
CameraProvider is an Android app that allows you to jump to the camera straight from a file open dialog.
A newly taken picture will be automatically delivered to the requesting app.

It simplifies attaching pictures in apps which provide a file open functionality, but don't have a
way to take a picture natively, including websites. Useful for communicators running in a web browser.
