# CameraProvider
A simple app for Android allowing you to take pictures on the fly when opening a file.

## Use
Open a file in any app making use of the standard Android file picker. CameraProvider can be chosen
as a file source to take a new picture instead of selecting an existing file. It will open your
phone's camera app and deliver a taken picture as a file to the requesting app.
